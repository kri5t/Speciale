\section{Trust - b}
We have obtained the best possible prediction through data manipulation and black box optimization which have been verified through our experiments. The network outputs a prediction which in itself could be used as decision support by the traders. The problematic here is for the users to know when it can be trusted and why to even trust it. People are not in the habit of blindly trusting everything that is placed in front of them and especially not when it comes to high-risk decisions. There is a need for making the black box more transparent by communicating what is happening inside it.

\subsection{The underlying data}
Artificial Neural Networks are known to be a black box\todo{ref}. Knowledge about the underlying data is only known by the ones who built the system. First and foremost the system must communicate the input parameters and where it comes from.

\subsection{Uncertain information}
The need for presenting uncertain information is presented in~\ref{sec:uncertainInformation}.
f.x. the difference in accuracy when in the lowest and highest numbers.

\subsection{WHAT SHOULD BE DONE}
\begin{itemize}
\item Improve understanding of the underlying data and the output;
\item Transparency is the goal;
\item Let the user take decisions based on the uncertain information;
\item Visualize errors;
\end{itemize}
