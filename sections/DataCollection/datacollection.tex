Historical weather data has been collected for various Danish weather stations from NOAA\footnote{\url{http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/}}. The data is in a fixed length format and contains all the necessary weather data for prediction. Format can be seen in BILAG 11111. 
The historical hourly price and wind production data has been downloaded from nordpoolspot\footnote{\url{www.nordpoolspot.com}} in excel format BILAG2.
The data will be aggregated into one file for each of the predictions containing the needed input and output parameters.

For the sake of simplicity we will be focusing on West Denmark also known as DK1 in noordpoolspot. Furthermore the collected data will be validated through plot diagrams that show and establish the relationship between weather conditions and the power generation/price of DK1.

A number of stations in West Denmark that we consider to be representative will be selected for testing purposes. We can do this because stations that are located near each other will have similar data (SEE PLOT) and therefore only a number of stations from each Danish region in DK1 are needed. Furthermore, the relatively small size of Denmark leads to uniform climate and weather conditions across the country which will reduce the total number of stations necessary (CITATION NEEDED).
