Energy price prediction is a cumbersome task to handle because of the highly volatile nature of price prediction \cite{pjmForecast} \cite{yamin2004adaptive} and the plethora of factors that influence the energy price\cite{singhal2011electricity}. In this section we will show the factors that influence the price by analyzing relevant data that will later become input in our ANN. Not too surprisingly; the most important factor in any market is demand and this greatly influences the price \cite{supplyAndDemand}. But also time of day, day of the week, wind speed and temperature (which are the quantifiable factors) play a big role. Sociocultural influences affects the price as well but are hard to measure \cite{singhal2011electricity}. This section will show the connection between electricity price and the influential factors.

\subsection{Price}\label{sec:Price}
We present some of the influences on the price in this section and argue why these parameters have an impact on the price. We also account for the time perspective and show the non-linear nature of energy prices. To accompany the graphs we also calculated the Pearson's correlations (section ~\ref{sec:Pearsons}) which can be seen in table ~\ref{table:pearsonsPriceVariables}.

Pearson's correlations:

\end{tabular}

\end{table}

The last known price has a great correlation to the price we are going to predict which can be seen in figure~\ref{fig:price_price} and by the Pearsons correlation of 0.89. Even though the price is volatile and have spikes it follows a pattern; which clearly shows us that the historical price development is very important when predicting the next prices.

\end{figure}

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Weather conditional influences}
\label{sec:priceWeatherInfluence}
The electricity price is affected by different weather conditions. We present temperature and wind speed and show how the correlation between them and the price is.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{billeder/energy_price_plots/price_temp.png}
\caption{Price and temperature plot.}
\label{fig:price_temp}
\end{figure}

In figure~\ref{fig:price_temp} and table~\ref{table:pearsonsPriceVariables} we see that there is nearly no correlation between temperature and the price. This indicates that we probably cannot use the temperature as a direct influence on the price. The temperature might have an indirect influence on the price since it has an influence on the demand. This variable can also say something about heating degree days and cooling degree days mentioned in \cite{19} and discussed later in this section.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{billeder/energy_price_plots/price_wind.png}
\caption{Price and wind speed plot.}
\label{fig:price_wind}
\end{figure}

In Figure ~\ref{fig:price_wind} we see how the wind impacts the price. If the wind speed increases the energy price decreases. This agrees with paper \cite{dayAheadImpactOfWindPowerForecasts} where they show that the wind influences the wind power production. The share of green energy produced from wind mills are approximately 25\% as off 2008(\cite{windPowerDanishLiberalized}) so we expect to see that the wind will have an impact on the price. When the production is high and the demand is moderate - the price will decrease because of overproduction and (since we cannot store energy for later use) the price will drop.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Seasonality}\label{sec:seasonality}
The price is influenced greatly by the seasonality. Seasonality covers the time of year but also the time-of-day and the day-of-the-week in this section. Seasonality plays a significant role in price prediction because the demand is affected by the demand of the people and since people follow patterns the demand does as well.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth ]{billeder/energy_price_plots/Average_price_over_weekdays.png}
\caption{Daily price dispersion}
\label{fig:price_over_weekdays}
\end{figure}

Figure ~\ref{fig:price_over_weekdays} shows us how the trend of the price varies over the different days in a week. The most noticeable here is how the price is decreasing in the weekend (Saturday and Sunday) and are somewhat steady for the weekdays. We are looking at two options for our neural network. We can represent it as a matrix (section ~\ref{sec:Matrix}) which is the most granulated method. We can also normalize the days 1-7 and represent all days with only 1 input neuron.
The graph show us a difference between highest (Wednesday) and lowest (Sunday) of 80 which is pretty much when the price fluctuates between 632 and 61 (with 1\% top and bottom trim see section ~\ref{sec:Trimming}).

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth ]{billeder/energy_price_plots/price_per_hour.png}
\caption{Hourly price dispersion}
\label{fig:price_per_hour}
\end{figure}

In Figure~\ref{fig:price_per_hour} we see the average price per hour over a whole day. We see a trend where the price is highest from 08 to 10 and again from 17 to 19. This is because most people wake up in the first interval and use a lot of electricity and the second interval is when everybody gets home and cooks dinner. The price can be represented (as described in price-over-weekdays) as a matrix or a single normalized input. The price fluctuates between 335(18) and 190(03) which gives us a difference of 145. This is a pretty significant difference between highest and lowest and will help us point the prediction in the right direction.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth ]{billeder/energy_price_plots/seasons.png}
\caption{Seasonal price dispersion}
\label{fig:seasons}
\end{figure}

The sesonality is also reflected in what time of year it is. In the winter time the electrical heating and need for electric light plays a significant role on how much electricity is consumed and thus the price goes up \cite{crowley2005weather}. This is shown in figure ~\ref{fig:seasons} where it clearly shows the average price is higher in winter and fall than in summer and spring.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth ]{billeder/energy_price_plots/averageMonthlyPrice.png}
\caption{Monthly price dispersion}
\label{fig:monthlyAveragePrice}
\end{figure}

To get a more fine grained representation of the seasonal influences on the price; we created a monthly distribution of the price. The figure ~\ref{fig:monthlyAveragePrice} shows that the highest average price is 360(february) and lowest 190(july). This is a significant price jump and shows the same trend as for the seasonal figure ~\ref{fig:seasons} but here we see the effects of the holidays in july; where the price is significantly lower than the rest of the year.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Volatility and High-Frequency}
\label{sec:volatility}
The electricity prices are very volatile and changes on an hourly basis. The electricity price is one of the most volatile entities in the commodity markets \cite{pjmForecast} if not the most volatile as they state in \cite{yamin2004adaptive}. The spikes are often reflected by the same input variables resulting in completely different results. The price has a very high frequency of spike prices. A spike price is a price that elevates very quickly and drops in a matter of a few hours. These conditions can be tricky to handle but we will here address some of the problems in handling volatility and spike prices.

In \cite{singhal2011electricity} they describe the factors that influence the price and causes them to be highly volatile:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Volatility in fuel price
 	\item Load uncertainty
 	\item Fluctuations in hydroelectricity production
 	\item Generation uncertainty (outages)
 	\item Transmission congestion
 	\item Behavior of market participant (based on anticipated price)
 	\item Market manipulation (market power, counterparty risk)
\end{itemize}
All of these factors influence the price and makes it very volatile/spiky. These factors are very hard to account for (find information on) and are not included in our analysis but has to be kept in mind when trying to predict the prices. 

Spikes are hard to predict and often impossible because of the limited occurrence of these (under 1\% in our dataset) and because they are so much higher than the rest of the max prices. Spikes can add an error factor to the dataset thus making it harder to predict the rest of the datasets values because the ANN will make adjustments for these high values. Trimming can be used to remove the majority of these datasets and have been used in \cite{singhal2011electricity} where they remove the prices above \$70 and also in \cite{yamin2004adaptive} where they trim the dataset if the price is above \$50. The trimming of course only makes sense to use if it actually improves the predictions. This has to be tested in our case to see if it makes an improvement or not.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth ]{billeder/energy_price_plots/same_hour_distribution.png}
\caption{Price ditribution over equal hours}
\label{fig:same_hour_distribution}
\end{figure}

In earlier figures we have shown how the input influences the price and given some reasons to why this influences the price. In figure~\ref{fig:same_hour_distribution} we have chosen similar hours across all days of a year and we show how different the price can be for similar inputs. The similar days have been chosen from the 'core' inputs (wind speed, temperature and demand) and the margins seen in table~\ref{table:similarHoursLimits} reflects the upper and lower bound of the inputs. The margins are calculated from a randomly chosen day and the interval is 10\% up and down. Even though the price is volatile we can see a trend in the graph that shows us that the price most of the time will be about 265.

\caption{A plot graph of the price development over the first 1500 hours in 2012}
\label{fig:plotGraph}
\end{figure}

The volatility of the price is clearly shown in~\ref{fig:same_hour_distribution} where the price on similar hours fluctuates from 215 to 345. To address the volatile nature of the price we need to look at the trends of the known historical price. If we take a look at the price plot in figure~\ref{fig:plotGraph} it clearly shows how volatile the price actually is. Another thing we can derive from the graph is how the price moves. It doesn't just jump from top to bottom of the interval but it takes some steps to get there (in most cases). This tendency can be used alongside the last known price to give the neural network a direction to follow and an approximate price as a point of origin. For more details on this see section~\ref{sec:usingStatisticalInput}. As an example we can take a price of 250 and a rising tendency then we have pointers for the price development and we can in general discard every possibility of a price that is under 250 -- since the tendency was rising. We can also discard the highest of numbers since the price in general doesn't jump several hundred and therefore we will have an idea of where the price is heading even though it is very volatile.

In the same manner we can address the high-frequency spike prices that occurs in the time series. We have to identify a tendency in the historical data and use this to make the predictions follow the steep spikes in the dataset. The volatility is often easier to handle than the spike prices because the volatility most of the times only causes small jumps in the price and these are easier to predict.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Demand}
Demand is directly connected to the energy prices (which comes as no suprise) since every market is driven by demand. Since demand is relative to the present time we are not able to use it directly as an input factor in the artificial neural network(ANN). We have a couple of choices here. We can take the demand from other instances like Nord Pool Spot; where they predict what the demand will be. We can compute the demand in artificial neural network and use the outputs as input for our price prediction ANN. At last we can try and substitute the demand input with the factors that plays a role in predicting the demand. The last two methods requires us to have an idea of what the input parameters for the prediction of demand is. As mentioned in related work we have seen a function that calculates the demand based on CDD(Cooling degree days), HDD(Heating degree days), ELD(Humidity), V$_w$ (Wind speed), M$_s$ (Sunshine), M$_r$ (Rainfall) \cite{19}. Based on this we will model the ANN to take the above mentioned factors as inputs.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth ]{billeder/energy_price_plots/price_consump_graph.png}
\caption{Demand and price plot.}
\label{fig:consump_price_graph}
\end{figure}

The price and consumption if mapped out in a graph shows that they follow the same trends see figure ~\ref{fig:consump_price_graph}. The demand and price does not follow the exact same pattern which also states that there are more factors that influence the price.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth ]{billeder/energy_price_plots/consump_price.png}
\caption{Demand and price plot.}
\label{fig:consump_price}
\end{figure}

In figure ~\ref{fig:consump_price} we see the connection between energy price and the demand. The model shows us that if the demand rises the price on the energy rises aswell. This is a common tendency in a market where there isn't endless supply. Since the price is heavily influenced by demand and demand is a relative factor the same calculations are also done by the powerplants because they need to know how much power to produce in a certain timeframe. We want to imitate this forecast and predict our own demand based on the aforementioned parameters. This is key to how accurate we will be able to predict the price. In other words: A good prediction of the demand will give us the right foundation for a good prediction of the price.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth ]{billeder/energy_price_plots/consump_temp.png}
\caption{Demand and temperature plot.}
\label{fig:consump_temp}
\end{figure}


In figure ~\ref{fig:consump_temp} we see the connection between demand and temperature. The temperature itself has an influence when it is very cold or very warm. This connection is expressed as CDD(Cooling degree days) and HDD(Heating degree days). In figure ~\ref{fig:consump_temp} we see that if temperature decreases the demand will go up. This is because the people of Denmark use a lot of energy on heating their homes and lighting them (HDD) in the winter time. In \cite{19} they also describe CDD which indicates the need for cooling. In Denmark it is limited how high the temperature goes and how often we actually need to cool our homes see table~\ref{table:CDD_HDD}. The table shows that we only have two days that are characterized as cool degree days. On the other hand we have a lot of heating degree days where we need heating. As they are the majority of the days we will use temperature as a measure for this. CDD and HDD are normally calculated as an index for how much of a need there is for cooling or heating respectively. Here we just present what days are categorized as either and not the index.

\begin{table}[H]

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}

\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth ]{billeder/energy_price_plots/consump_wind.png}
\caption{Demand and wind speed plot.}
\label{fig:consump_wind}
\end{figure}

Wind speed plays a role in predicting electrical demand. The wind affects the electrical heating needed in homes across the country. The wind cools down the houses and thus need for heating arises \cite{19}. As seen in figure ~\ref{fig:consump_wind} and in table ~\ref{table:pearsonsPriceVariables} there is a pretty good correlation between wind speed and demand. The graph clearly shows us that; when the wind speed increases (from 15 and up) the overall demand increases aswell. This indicates that high wind speeds will have th greatest influence on the demand.


%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Conclusion}
The above analysis of the data inputs have shown what parameters are more likely to influence the price than others. The last-known price and the price to predict showed a 0.89 pearsons correlation and a graph that showed a close to linear correlation between the two. The weather conditional factors did not show the most convincing correlations with the price. The wind speed showed the best correlation and are the most likely to show and impact. The seasonality of the data was pictured in graphs and the connection between time of day, day of week, month of year and season of year was pretty obvious. We therefore expect them to have a great impact on the price. The volatility and high frequency section showed us that there might be a need for trimming and a need for graph analysis to make the predictions more accurate. The demand section showed how demand and price followed the same pattern and that they are connected. The pearsons correlation between the two are not the best but we still expect it to be very important for the accuracy of the predictions.
