Neural works as basis for a decision support system. If ANN can predict can it then be used in the real life? Discussion about how this is related the text where the results are ambiguous 
Artificial Neural Networks can it itself be considered as a Optimization Based Support Model which is described in Section \todo{section and discuss further}. The trust of the forecast is critical and especially when dealing with ANNs because they are a black box. 

Discuss this in relation to DSS and how it relates to it. It is here important to emphasize that in order to use this a lot of things around it has to be build. When used in a real life setting the user just need to know the input, a high level description of what happens and then the output.
This is not a one-click solution and it requires a lot of configuration \todo{vi har masser skrevet om dette, ref, trade-offs, small / big values. Step-ahead forecasting, trimming, size}. The system is for experts and they can base there prediction on there own experience --- for instance an expert might now that high prices now together with the current market won't most likely won't result in lower prices, therefore the system does not need to consider low values. High configurable but still easy-to-use.
