Black box showed in both cases what was expected of it. The best set-up must be found through experiments and testing. Fine-tuning the network is done by testing different epochs and size of data. It also revealed the expected over- and under-fitting when either using too many epochs or too few. To much data can also result in overtraining since the network cannot generalize beyond a certain amount of data --- the right amount must be found in experiments.
