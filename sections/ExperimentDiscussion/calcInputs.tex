 Calculated inputs were applied in both predictions and showed slight improvement. In electricty price prediction the small improvement was seen with curve, skewness and volatility as input but saw no difference when applying scatter\todo{see section}. The best result was the combination of skew and volatility but significantly better than the other combinations. In the case prediction of wind power production the use of volatility was the only one showing an improvement. What can be concluded here is how adding more characteristics about the movement of the curve can help the generalization of the network to approach its target even though only slightly. Further analysis and experimentation with other methods could possibly lead to better performance \todo{ref to alternatives in economics}.
