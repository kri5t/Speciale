The strength of the prediction is very much dependent on the quality of the underlying data. As described in Section~\ref{sec:dataCollection} the data must satisfy certain criteria before it can be used as input and output in the Artificial Neural Network. It must be trustworthy and contain hourly observations for our specific purpose, e.g. day-ahead prediction based on a dataset that consists of hourly observations. All calculations in the ANN are based on this data which makes it of utmost importance for the output, the forecast.
