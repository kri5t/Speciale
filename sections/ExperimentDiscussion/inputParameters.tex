The most basic foundation for the Artificial Neural Network is the input parameters. The need for identifying what influences the value to predict is the first step when predicting. The analysis of both electricity price and wind production in Section\todo{analysis section} together with the experiments show how the combination of the right parameters is the core to a good prediction. The analysis section establishes the co-relation between input/output which is then validated through the experiments. Analysis of the network is complex due to the black box nature of ANNs. It finds connections and combinations of input that you cant statistically or logically foresee \todo{exemplify}.

It is obvious from the two predictions that the same calculated input does not apply for both. Curve is bas for wind power production whereas it has no effect on the price prediction.

\todo{A VERY DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF THE INPUT IS NEEDED --- talk about that}
\todo{discuss that we are not using predicted weather data}

Seasonality is significant in both. Size of training set is the same due to this fact. Less is better in both cases since they posses same characteristics in relation to volatility, seasonality and are both highly related to the electricity market seen in the co-relation to consumption.
