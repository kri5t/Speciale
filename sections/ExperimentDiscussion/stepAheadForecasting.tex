The step-ahead forecasting showed how the less hours to predict the better mae. In electricity prices the error is linear to the number of steps to predict until a certain point (around 8) where it flattens out. It is necessary to identify a technique to reduce the elevation of errors from step to step. The problem is not as significant in wind power production because it heavily relies on wind speed and can follow it whereas the price relies greatly on the last known price --- thus making it more likely to elevate the error.
