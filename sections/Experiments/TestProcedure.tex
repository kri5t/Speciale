The following high level test procedure will be followed for experiments of both wind production and electricity prices. 

Describe the process from input selection to black box optimization where epochs is investigated.

A test environment that execute all possible combinations. 

The network topology of the different neurons and layers are discovered by using pruning of the network whenever the combination of input parameters change. Pruning is discussed in Section~\ref{sec:pruning}.

All tests are done by predicting an entire year which is around 8600 hours.

\todo{HUSK AT LAV ET EKSPERIMENT PAA OVERFITTING}

It is run under these circumstances. We assume that 8000 hours of prediction in the following experiments is enough to be considered general. \todo{how do we explain that it is not realistic in the time that we have to do more tests since it would take 1 months just for one test}

for testing purposes and simplicity the top-3 of every experiment will be moved on to test the next strategy and in prediction all improvements count.
