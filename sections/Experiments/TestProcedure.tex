The following high level test procedure will be followed for experiments of both wind production and electricity prices. 

Describe the process from input selection to black box optimization where epochs is investigated.

A test environment that execute all possible combinations. 

The network topology of the different neurons and layers are discovered by using pruning of the network whenever the combination of input parameters change. Pruning is discussed in Section~\ref{sec:pruning}.

All tests are done over and entire year which means around 8600 hours.
