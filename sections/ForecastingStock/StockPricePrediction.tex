The ability of Neural Networks to forecast is seen in \cite{stockForecasting}. The stock price movements have similarities with electricity prices in terms of its non-linearity and chaotic/dynamic nature. Investors must take into account these factors when handling time series that are non-stationary, noisy and have structural breaks. In addition macro-economical elements significantly influence stock prices, e.g the economy in general, politics, bank rates and expectations of investors could be examples of such influences.

The solution for stock price forecasting in \cite{stockForecasting} is a hybrid forecasting model called Wavelet De-Noising-based Back Propagation (WDBP) Neural Network. In brief, the network is based on a wavelet transformation function that analyses non-stationary characteristics of the time series by decomposing the original data. The function produces a signal that is further decomposed into a low-pass and high-pass filter for every neuron in the network. The low-pass filter reflects main characteristics of the signal, opposed to the high-pass filter that represents noise. The purpose of the decomposition is to separate stock price characteristics from noise so that prediction will have better chances of accuracy when all undesirable has been discarded. The signal without the noise is then propagated through the Neural Network using back propagation.
