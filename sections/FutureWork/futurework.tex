This is future work.


\todo{initialization of random weights === different results ... should train more for better results, but they only test 10 weeks. --> adaptive forecasting}

\todo{adaptive forecasting --- use weights that worked last time instead of initial randomization}

Trimming\todo{section}

\todo{have we tested enough --- the time it takes to do all testing. You need to be smaaart --- use intuition}

TODO: talk about how testing is time consuming. All tests run for long time

TODO: the results are not definitive but what we can do is see tendencies in what parameters really matter.

TODO: ideal world endless test --> neural network requires a lot of testing
