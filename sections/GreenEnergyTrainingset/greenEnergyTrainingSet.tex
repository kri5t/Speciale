It is not surprising that weather conditions directly impact the wind power generation. The typical input parameters for wind power prediction are wind speed, temperature, pressure and humidity \cite{WindPowerGenerationUsingANN} with the most influential factor being wind speed because it is directly converted to power in the wind turbine. The following subsection will describe the collection of this data and how it is used in the modelled 

\subsection{Input Data}
The collected data for wind power prediction is described above. This subsection will go into further detail with these parameters and show their relationship with wind production.

\subsubsection{Wind Speed}
The relationship between hourly wind speed and hourly wind power production of DK1 is seen in figure~\ref{fig:windVsProd}. The wind power is averaged from the 11 selected stations and the relationship is as expected. The more wind the more wind power is produced.

\subsubsection{Relative Humidity}
The dew point is a water-to-air saturation temperature. The dew point is associated with relative humidity. A high relative humidity indicates that the dew point is closer to the current air temperature. Relative humidity of 100\% indicates the dew point is equal to the current temperature and that the air is maximally saturated with water. When the dew point remains constant and temperature increases, relative humidity decreases.[1]

\subsection{Modelling Artificial Neural Network}
The ANN will be trained with input the hourly parameters of wind speed, temperature, pressure and humidity and then compared to the actual production of that hour.
