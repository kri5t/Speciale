This section discusses the results based on both electricity prices and wind production.

\todo{discuss how different starting points in both cases affected the predictions. Nobody else discusses that the predictions heavily depends on the starting point. We still believe the results to be correct since they were compared based on the same starting points and therefore predicted the same hours}

\todo{compare trimming in more detail}
\todo{discuss reconfigurability of the system when used in real life setting}

\todo{compare matrix between price and production. It is obvious that the bigger difference between high and low during the day makes the benefits from matrix more clear for price than for production}.

\todo{USE THE MODEL FROM UNCERTAIN INFORMATION}

\todo{discuss how the two predictions are related which is seen by the connection between wind speed and price and the 'Day-Ahead Electricity Prices in Denmark: The Impact for Wind Power Forecasts}

\todo{discusss why wind power production variations (as described in the introduction) was not used in electricity price}

\todo{relate to why we can do this without expert help but the next step to integrate a fully working dss would require expert to know what to do configurable}
