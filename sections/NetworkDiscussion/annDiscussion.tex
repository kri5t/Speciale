The purpose is to discuss what came out of the wind power and electricity price results from the experimental results. The results will be compared to each other but also related to literature.
\todo{compare trimming in more detail}
\todo{discuss reconfigurability of the system when used in real life setting}

\subsection{Future work}
\input{sections/ExperimentDiscussion/futureWork.tex}

\todo{USE THE MODEL FROM UNCERTAIN INFORMATION}

\todo{discuss how the two predictions are related which is seen by the connection between wind speed and price and the 'Day-Ahead Electricity Prices in Denmark: The Impact for Wind Power Forecasts}

\todo{discusss why wind power production variations (as described in the introduction) was not used in electricity price}

\todo{relate to why we can do this without expert help but the next step to integrate a fully working dss would require expert to know what to do configurable}
