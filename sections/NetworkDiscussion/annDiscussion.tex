This section discusses the results based on both electricity prices and wind production.

\subsection{The importance of the underlying data}
The strength of the prediction is very much dependent on the underlying data.  

The data must come from a trusted source so that proper predictions can be based on it. The data must be of a certain quality in relation number of observations and how  

\subsubsection{Input parameters}
\todo{this section is pretty obvious when looking at our analysis. You need to establish relationship between the output and the input parameters}

\subsubsection{Data Manipulation - k}
De andre tekster undlader i stor omfang at snakke om input i forhold til konkret data, trimming og manipulation af det konkrete data. Sammenstil det med vores eget. Reflekter og konkluder.

== the best possible prediction. Hvad er med til at give det ebdsre result.

all our findings apply on both systems (green/price). It emphasizes the need for manipulation of data in all networks even though different measures to be met.
