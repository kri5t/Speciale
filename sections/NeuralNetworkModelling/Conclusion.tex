\section{Conclusion}
When modeling the network it is necessary to experiment with different types of inputs, hidden layers and neurons to find the best combinations. Furthermore, it is important to investigate the number of training epochs in order to find the best fit so that the networks training will not be under-fitted or over-fitted. We also have to experiment with the best data manipulation to find the best representation for the input parameters. When doing multiple step-ahead forecasting the immediate trend must be transferred as input to the next step, e.g. by including statistical economical features.
