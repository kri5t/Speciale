The simplest way to model the network is to simply take all input parameters from the time-series without altering or analysing them - this is a naive approach. In the following subsections we will describe different strategies to data set manipulation from the most naive approach to more refined approaches where trimming and analysis of values is considered before sending the input to the network. These strategies will used in experiments with the actual networks to locate the best possible strategy.
