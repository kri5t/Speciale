This section will describe our considerations when building and modelling our network. The forecasting models will be implemented using an Artificial Neural Network with back propagation where it takes as input a time series and in return outputs the predicted value. The specific input parameters will be described in the sections of the two specific prediction networks - price and wind production.
The simplest way to model the network is to take all input parameters from the time-series without altering or analysing them - this is a naive approach. In the following subsections we will describe different strategies to data set manipulation from the most naive approach to more refined approaches where trimming and analysis of values is considered before sending the input to the network. These strategies will used in experiments with the actual networks to locate the best possible strategy.

  EASY TO DO NAIVE

we add a module that will 



do some figures of the network design/model. Also talk about the number of hidden layers must be experimented with to find the best result. - underfit and overfit as well.
