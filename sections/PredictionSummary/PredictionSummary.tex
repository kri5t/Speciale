\subsubsection{Summary}
Artificial Neural Network examples have been presented in the related work section. The characteristics of the electricity prices have been refreshed and different predictions methods have been presented. 
In the description of ANN prediction it is worth observing the input parameters of the network and the way it is modelled. The demand input could potentially consist of input parameters that represents the influential factors for the demand such as the meteorological and socio-economic factors.

ANN can be used in combination with other technologies in an attempt to improve performance and accuracy. This should be considered.
Furthermore, two other examples of predicting and how they relate to ANN is described. This further motivates our choice of ANN as prediction method.   

\subsection{Summary}
Seem shitty with two summaries just after each other! What to do?

This section introduced the concepts and approaches of electricity demand, green energy production and electricity prices. What is somewhat noticeable is the similarity between the influential factors --- especially when it comes to price and demand. They are all dependent on weather data. This indicate that we can approach the wind power production and electricity price prediction with the same Artificial Neural Network simply by replacing the training set and the number of inputs.
