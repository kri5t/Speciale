Decision support systems(DSS) have developed a lot since the beginning of computers but have always been a part of what computers were good for. This section touched a little bit upon the history of DSS and how it went from being a standalone computer used by a handful of people to cross country DSS that help people in big organizations to make better decisions. It also evolved into being automatic computer aided salesmen that based on data from big data warehouses tries to predict what the user wants to buy next or interested in. They also talk about the the formulation, solution and analysis stages which incorporates intelligent systems that do big calculations and present them to the user/agent in a neat and ready to use fashion.

DSS interfaces must integrate and show uncertain information. The users must be made aware of any information that can have an affect on their decision. Guidelines for visualizing and structuring of information to support the best decision making is presented. These can be used as a starting point for our DSS.
