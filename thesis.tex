\section{Prediction}
Being able to predict electricity prices and green energy production is the basis for our thesis. Demand has a huge impact on the electricity price so this is also handled here. This section will introduce and give selected examples of these concepts within the different areas.

\chapter{Dataset Analysis and Method}
This chapter analyses the potential input parameters to determine which ones should be used in the Artificial Neural Network. It will include the process from data collection and manipulation to the actual prediction strategies that will be used by our Artificial Neural Network.
